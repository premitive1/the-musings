# the-musings
A collection of essays created for Bitcoin Brunch.
On October 3, 2021 I read the first of what would turn into an ongoing series of writings attempting to inject into my casual meetup a semblance of focus and thought provocation. Approaching 100 of such essays, it seems appropriate to make the musings available for others to read as I move towards the transition of writing to editing, in hopes of eventually publishing the whole collection. Some friends suggested github as a good place to share until the point at which I want to publish the whole things. I also think some of these essays lend themselves to visualizations. I specifically have in mind turning a few into comics.
I welcome anyone interested in contributing art, editing,  questions for clarification, or other contributions.
